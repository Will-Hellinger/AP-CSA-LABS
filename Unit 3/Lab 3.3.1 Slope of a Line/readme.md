# 3.3.1 SlopeOfALine
Write a program that will allow the user to enter an four int values, x1, y1, x2, and y2, that represent two points on a line. If the line is not a vertical line, calculate and print the slope of the line. If the line is vertical, output a statement stating that the line is a vertical line and the slope is undefined.

Slope formula: `slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)`

<i>Hint: 1/2 should result in a slope of</i> `0.5`

Here are some sample runs. Use this format for your output.
```
Enter x1: 3
Enter y1: 4
Enter x2: 3
Enter y2: 7
The line defined by the points (3, 4) and (3, 7) is a vertical line and the slope is undefined.

Enter x1: 9
Enter y1: 7
Enter x2: -12
Enter y2: 13
The line defined by the points (9, 7) and (-12, 13) has a slope of -0.2857142857142857.

Enter x1: 5
Enter y1: 15
Enter x2: 7
Enter y2: 15
The line defined by the points (5, 15) and (7, 15) has a slope of 0.0.
