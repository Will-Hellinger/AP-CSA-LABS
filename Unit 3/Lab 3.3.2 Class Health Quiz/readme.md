# 3.3.2 ClassHealthQuiz
Write a program that will assess your Computer Science class “academic” health. Create at least five yes or no questions to identify whether or not a student has good class habits. For each yes answer, add a point to the student’s score. When the quiz is over, report to the student if their class health is good or not. You can set the range. You may use these questions, or come up with your own, but if you do use these questions, be sure to add at least two more of your own design.

<i>Caution: All questions and output must be school appropriate.</i>

Here are some sample runs. Use this format as a guide for your output. This program will be manually graded.
