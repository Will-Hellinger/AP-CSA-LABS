# 3.7.1 ClassHealthQuizRevisited
Rewrite the program you did in an earlier lesson that assesses your Computer Science class health. Create yes or no questions to identify whether or not a student has good class habits. For each yes answer, add a point to the student’s score. <b>This time, have the user input a String (“y”) or a String (“n”) and use the String equals method</b>. When the quiz is over, report to the student if their class health is good or not. You can set the range. Caution: All questions and output must be school appropriate.

Here are two sample runs. Use this format for your output.
