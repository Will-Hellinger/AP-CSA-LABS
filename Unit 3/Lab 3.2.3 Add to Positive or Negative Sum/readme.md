# 3.2.3 AddToPositiveOrNegativeSum
Write a program to allow the user to input ten `int` values using a loop.

* If the number is negative, add the number to a variable to store a negative sum.
* If the number is positive, add the number to a different variable to store a positive sum.
* At the conclusion of the program, output the sums.

Use the starter file and enter your code segments in the commented areas that describe the given tasks. Notice the code for user input and the conditional for adding to one of the sums is inside a for loop. You will learn about for loops in the next unit, but you will use a loop in this program now.

Here is a sample run.
```
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: -2
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: -33
Enter a number: 35
Enter a number: -6
Enter a number: 12
Enter a number: 0
Enter a number: 15
The sum of the positive numbers is 81.
The sum of the negative numbers is -41.
