# 3.5.1 CookieOrders(IfIf) - Lab 2 of 2
## <b>This is the same lab, but solution requirements are slightly different. Read instructions carefully.</b>
- - -

Write a program that will calculate the cost of a cookie order, given the number of boxes of cookies ordered. The following chart breaks down the cost per box based on the number of boxes ordered.

1 – 4 boxes: 6.95 per box
5 – 9 boxes: 5.95 per box
10 – 15 boxes: 5.50 per box
16 or more boxes: 4.95 per box

Your program should print a menu explaining the cost of the cookies and then allow for input. If the input is invalid, print an appropriate message.

Output the number of boxes purchased, the cost per box, and the total cost of the cookies. Your output should be in the format shown below.

There are two versions of this program that you will need to write, one by nesting in the else’s, and one by nesting in the if’s. Be sure to test your program thoroughly.

Here are two sample runs of the program:
```
