# 3.2.2 FindLarge
Write a program that will allow the user to input two numeric values and output which value is the larger of the two. If the two numbers are the same, then the output should reflect that they are equal.

Here are three sample runs. Use this format for your output.
```
Enter the first number: 55
Enter the second number: 72
72 is larger than 55.

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 10
10 and 10 are equal.

Enter the first number: -2
Enter the second number: -10
-2 is larger than -10.
