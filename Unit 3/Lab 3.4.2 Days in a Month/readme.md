# 3.4.2 DaysInAMonth
Write a program that will ask the user for a month number,
(1 â€“ 12), and will output the month as a String and the number of days in that month. If the user inputs a number that is out of range, print an appropriate message.

Here are several sample runs of the program:
```
Enter the month number (1 - 12): 1
January has 31 days.

Enter the month number (1 - 12): 4
April has 30 days.

Enter the month number (1 - 12): 2
February has 28 days or 29 days in a leap year.

Enter the month number (1 - 12): 9
September has 30 days.

Enter the month number (1 - 12): 23
23 is invalid input.
