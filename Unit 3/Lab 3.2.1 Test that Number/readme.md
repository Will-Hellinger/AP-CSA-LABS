# 3.2.1 TestThatNumber
Write a program that will allow the user to enter an
int. Using if statements, test the following and print out the following, replacing num with the input value:

1. if the number is positive, print “num is a positive number.”
2. if the number is 0, print “num is equal to zero.”
3. if the number is negative, print “num is a negative number.”
4. if the number is nonnegative, print “num is a nonnegative number.”
5. if the number is nonpositive, print “num is a nonpositive number.”
6. if the number is even, print “num is an even number.”
7. if the number is odd, print “num is an odd number.”
8. if the number is divisible by 10, print “num is divisible by 10.”
9. if the number is not divisible by 10, print “num is not divisible by 10.”

Here are two sample runs. Use this format for your output.
```
Enter a number: -7
-7 is a negative number.
-7 is a nonpositive number.
-7 is an odd number.
-7 is not divisible by 10.

Enter a number: 6
6 is a positive number.
6 is a nonnegative number.
6 is an even number.
6 is not divisible by 10.
