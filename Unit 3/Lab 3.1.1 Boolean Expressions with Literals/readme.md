# 3.1.1 BooleanExpressionsWithLiterals
Write a program that will print the value of each of the expressions shown below each on a separate line. Evaluate each of the expressions by hand BEFORE you run your program and compare your answers to what your program prints.
```
    +----------------------------+
    | 5 * 18 != 5 * 3 + 5 * 6    |
    | -13 == -13.0               |
    | -13 <= -13.0               |
    | 15 % 5 == 0                |
    | 7 + 9 / 2 >= 7 + 9 % 2     |
    | 7.1 + 9.5 != 16.6          |
    | 5.2 < 6.1                  |
    | 100 % 2 == 0               |
    | 0 % 2 == 0                 |
    | 100 % 3 == 0               |

public class BooleanExpressionsWithLiterals
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.printlnt(5 * 10 != % * 3 + 5 * 6);
        //Add the rest of the boolean expressions after you have determined the output
    }
}
