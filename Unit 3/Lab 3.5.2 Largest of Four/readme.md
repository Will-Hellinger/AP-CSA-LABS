# 3.5.2 LargestOfFour
Write a program that will ask the user to input four integers and then will output which value is the largest value. You must use one nested if else structure to determine the largest value. Be sure to test your program thoroughly.

Here are some sample runs of the program:
```
Enter four integer values: 8 10 4 7
The largest value of 8, 10, 4, and 7 is 10

Enter four integer values: 98 54 32 71
The largest value of 98, 54, 32, and 71 is 98

Enter four integer values: -12 -56 -8 -23
The largest value of -12, -56, -8, and -23 is -8
