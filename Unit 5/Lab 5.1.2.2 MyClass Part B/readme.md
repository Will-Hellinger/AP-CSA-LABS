# 5.1.2.2 MyClass Part B
Using the video found in this lesson, <b>The Bell Class - A Case Study, Part Two - Public vs Private</b>, as a guide, adapt the class begun in Part A, designating each part as either public or private as appropriate.

Here is the basic structure for this program solution.
```
//Lab 05.1.2.2 - Part B - MyClass

/*
  This is the main driver class which matches the name of the file. 
  Do not change this header.
*/
     public class Driver
     {
      public static void main(String[] args) {

        //instantiate your own default object and output it

        //Change this to match your own class definition
        <your class name here> me1 = new <your class name here>();
        System.out.println(me1);

        //instantiate a two-parameter object and output it
      }
    }

/*
  Copy your completed class definition from Lab 05.1.2.1 here 
  and designate each element as private or public as appropriate.
  As you did in the first lab, you may create a new file and place
  your class definition there.
*/
class <your class name here>

{

//your class definition here 

}
```
