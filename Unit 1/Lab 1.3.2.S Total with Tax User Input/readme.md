# 1.3.2.S TotalWithTaxUserInput
Write a program that will print the price of an item that has been purchased, the sales tax applied to that purchase and the total cost. Declare a constant of type double for the tax rate named `TAXRATE` and assign a value of `0.0825` to the constant. Declare double variables for the price of the item, tax amount and the total cost named `price`, `tax` and `total`. Prompt the user of the price of the item, read the price from the console and then assign that value to `price`. Calculate the tax amount and assign that value to `tax`. Then, using the variables `price` and `tax`, calculate the total cost and assign that value to `totalCost`. A sample run and example output is shown below.

```
Enter the price: 20
Price: $20.0
Sales Tax: $1.6500000000000001
Total: $21.65
