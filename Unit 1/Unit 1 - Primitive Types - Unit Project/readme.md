# Unit 1 - Primitive Types - Unit Project
Using your textbooks from science or math class, or using the Internet, find formulas to convert 10 different measurement values from one unit to another.

For example, convert Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius, or convert pounds to kilograms.

For each of the conversions you choose:
1. Output the conversion to be shown.
2. Output the formula used to make the conversion.
3. Input from the keyboard a value to be converted, using an appropriate prompt.
4. Output the formula with the input value inserted.
5. Show the final result, properly labeled, with all values rounded to two places of precision.

For a temperature conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius, the output should be:
```
Fahrenheit to Celsius
C = 5 / 9(F - 32)
Enter Fahrenheit temperature: 100
C = 5 / 9 (100 - 32)
100 degrees Fahrenheit = 37.78 degrees Celsius
```
After you have determined and found all conversion formulas, write the program to produce all ten outputs in the format described and shown in the example.

All real number values must be rounded to two decimal places. There should be one blank line between each conversion. <i>You must use expressions in calculations and declare variables to complete the project.</i>

Here is an example showing three possible conversions. You may use kilometers to miles and gallons to ounces as two of the conversions in your project, but <b>you may not use Fahrenheit to Celsius.</b>
```
Fahrenheit to Celsius
C = 5 / 9(F - 32)
Enter Fahrenheit temperature: 100
C = 5 / 9 (100 - 32)
100 degrees Fahrenheit = 37.78 degrees Celsius

Kilometers to Miles
//formula not shown
Enter the kilometers: 5
5.0 kilometers = 3.11 miles

Gallons to Ounces
//formula not shown
Enter the gallons: 0.33
0.33 gallons = 42.24 ounces
```
