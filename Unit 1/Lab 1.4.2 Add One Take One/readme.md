# 1.4.2 AddOneTakeOne
Write a program that will allow the user to enter a single whole number into an `int` variable. <b>Using only the increment and decrement operators and only the one variable used for input</b>, decrement the variable by 1, output it, increment it to its original value, output it, and then increment it once more, outputting it a third time. All three values are to be output on one line with a single space between each. Here is a sample run and its output.

### <b>Sample Run:</b>
```
Enter a number: 5
4 5 6
