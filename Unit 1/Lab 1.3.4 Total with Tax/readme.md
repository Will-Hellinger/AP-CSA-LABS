# 1.3.4 TotalWithTax
Write a program to print the `price` of a purchased item, the `sales tax` applied to that purchase and the `total cost`.

Declare a <b>constant</b> of type `double` named `TAXRATE` for the tax rate and assign to it the value `0.0825`. Declare `double` variables for the price of the item, tax amount and the total cost named `price`, `tax` and `totalCost`. Assign to `price` the value `$52.75`. Calculate the tax amount using `price` and `TAXRATE` and assign that value to `tax`. Using the variables price and tax, calculate and assign the total cost to `totalCost`.

The output should be on three separate lines and labeled as shown below. (We will learn how to round off to the nearest penny in Topic 1.5)

```
Price: $52.75
Sales Tax: $4.351875000000001
Total: $57.101875
