# 1.3.5 TempConversion
Write a complete program to convert the current temperature where you are from `Fahrenheit` to `Celsius`.

Determine the current Fahrenheit temperature and find the formula for the conversion before you begin.

Declare appropriately named variables of the correct type for each value you use in the program, including the <b>assigned Fahrenheit temperature</b> and the <b>calculated equivalent Celsius value</b>. The output should be appropriately labeled.

### <b>Sample Fahrenheit temperature:</b> `85`

### <b>Expected output:</b>
```
85.0 degrees Fahrenheit = 29.444444444444446 degrees Celsius
```

### <b>Note: The output value for Celsius MUST be the result of a calculation assigned to a variable, not just hardcoded into the output statement.</b>
