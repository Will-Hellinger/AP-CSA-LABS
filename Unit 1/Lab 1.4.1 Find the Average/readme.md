# 1.4.1 FindTheAverage
Write a program that will print the average of 4 decimal values that have been entered by the user. Include meaningful prompts and label the output. Your program will need a double type variable to store the values entered by the user and a double type variable to store a running total of the values. You must use compound assignment to add up the values each time the user enters a value. Here is a sample run and its output.

```
Enter four values.
Value 1: 15.25
Value 2: 14.10
Value 3: 18.75
Value 4: 10.90
Average = 14.75
```
