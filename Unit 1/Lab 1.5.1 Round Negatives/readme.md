# 1.5.1 RoundNegatives
In <b>Lesson 1.5.4 Rounding</b> you learned how to round a positive decimal number to a whole number. Modify the algorithm to round a positive value and use it to write a program that will allow the user to enter a negative decimal number and then prints that number rounded to the nearest whole number.

Test your program using `-3.21` and `-9.86`. Here is a sample run for both test values.
```
=====================================================================
Enter a negative decimal number: -3.21
-3.21 rounded to a whole number is -3

Enter a negative number: -9.86
-9.86 rounded to a whole number is -10
=====================================================================
