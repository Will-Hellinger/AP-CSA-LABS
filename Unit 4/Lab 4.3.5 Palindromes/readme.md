# 4.3.5 Palindromes
A palindrome is any word that is spelled the same both forwards and backwards.

Two examples are `civic` and `radar`. Write a program that will determine if a word entered by the user is a palindrome.

There is no starter file for this lab. You must write the entire class.

Here are some sample runs:
```
Enter a word: civic
civic is a palindrome.

Enter a word: radar
radar is a palindrome.

Enter a word: computer
computer is not a palindrome.
```
