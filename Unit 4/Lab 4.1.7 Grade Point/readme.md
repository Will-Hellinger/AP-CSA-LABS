# 4.1.7 GradePoint
Write a program that requires the user to enter exactly 7 letter grades, A, B, C, D, or F. The program should then calculate a grade point average using the following scale.

```
A = 4.0
B = 3.0
C = 2.0
D = 1.0
F = 0.0
```

The program should print the grade point average <i><b>rounded to 2 decimal places</i></b>. (Hint: You will be using else if statements and (int)(x + 0.5) will round x to a whole number.)

There is no starter file for this lab. You must write the entire class. Here is a sample run:
```
Enter seven letter grades (A, B, C, D or F)
A
B
C
D
F
A
A
GPA = 2.57
