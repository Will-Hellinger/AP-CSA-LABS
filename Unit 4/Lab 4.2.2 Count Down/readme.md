Write a program that allows the user to enter two whole numbers. The first number should be smaller than the second number. <b>Use a loop</b> to print all of the numbers from the second number down to the first number. Print each number on same line. If the first number is larger than the second number, then the program should not print anything. Here is a sample run:

```
First number: 0
Second number: 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
```
