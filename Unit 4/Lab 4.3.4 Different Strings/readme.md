# 4.3.4 DifferentStrings
Write a program that will allow the user to enter two words. The program should then print if the two words are the same or are different. If they are different, the program should print the position of the first letter that is different. Print the actual position of the differing letters not the index value. For example the third letter in “horse” and “house” is different so your program should print 3.

There is no starter file for this lab. You must write the entire class. Here are three possible sample runs:
```
First word: aardvark
Second word: aardvark
aardvark and aardvark are the same.
```
```
First word: bowl
Second word: bowling
bowl and bowling are the not same. They differ at letter number 5.
```
```
First word: tiger
Second word: turtle
tiger and turtle are the not same. They differ at letter number 2.
