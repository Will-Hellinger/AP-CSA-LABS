# 4.4.4 FindingPrimes2
Modify the <b>FindingPrimes</b> program from <b>Lesson 4.4.3 Finding Prime Numbers</b> (shown in the editor) so that the program will not report the value 1 as a prime number if the user enters 1 as a starting place. In addition to allowing 1 as input, allow the user to enter the starting and ending values in any order, smallest first or largest first. Finally, do not allow the user to enter negative values.

Here are several possible sample runs:
```
Enter two positive numbers: -10 25 
Numbers must be greater than zero. Please try again.
Enter two positive numbers: 10 25
11 13 17 19 23 
Enter two positive numbers: 25 10
11 13 17 19 23 
Enter two positive numbers: 1 15
2 3 5 7 11 13 
```
