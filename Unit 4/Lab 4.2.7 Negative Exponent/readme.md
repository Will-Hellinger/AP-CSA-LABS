# 4.2.7 NegativeExponent
Modify lab 4.2.6 so that the user may enter a positive or negative base and a positive or negative exponent. Powers are no longer limited to Integer.MAX_VALUE. Again, <b>DO NOT use Math.pow(x,y)</b>. (Hint: Variables can no longer all be int type.)

There is no starter file for this lab. You must write the entire class. Here are four sample runs:
```
Enter the base: 2
Enter the exponent: 4
2 ^ 4 = 16.0
Enter the base: -3
Enter the exponent: 3
-3 ^ 3 = -27.0

Enter the base: 2
Enter the exponent: -2
2 ^ -2 = 0.25
Enter the base: -2
Enter the exponent: -3
-2 ^ -3 = -0.125
```
