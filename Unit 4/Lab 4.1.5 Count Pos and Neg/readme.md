Write a program that allows the user to enter both positive and negative numbers until zero has been entered. The program should then report the number of positive values entered and the number of negative values entered. Here is a sample run:

```
Enter a positive or negative number or 0 to quit: 5
Enter a positive or negative number or 0 to quit: -7
Enter a positive or negative number or 0 to quit: 3
Enter a positive or negative number or 0 to quit: -8
Enter a positive or negative number or 0 to quit: 10
Enter a positive or negative number or 0 to quit: -1
Enter a positive or negative number or 0 to quit: 6
Enter a positive or negative number or 0 to quit: 0
There were 4 positive numbers and 3 negative numbers.
