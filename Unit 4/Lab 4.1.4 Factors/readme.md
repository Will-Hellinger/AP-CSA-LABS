# 4.1.4 Factors
A value X is a factor of a value Y if Y is divisible by X. For example the positive factors of a Y value 12 are X values 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.

Write a program that modifies lab 4.1.3 to enable a user to enter a number and the program prints all of the positive factors of that number.

A sample run might look like this:
```
Enter your number: 12
The factors of 12 are: 1 2 3 4 6 12
```
