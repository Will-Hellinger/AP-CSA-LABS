# 4.2.6 Power
Write a program that asks the user for two whole numbers that represent a base and an exponent. Print the value of the base raised to the power of the exponent. For example, if the user enters 3 and 4, then print the value of 3^4. In this case 3*3*3*3 which is 81.

You must use a for loop to calculate the answer. <b>DO NOT use Math.pow(x,y)</b>.

For this problem you may assume no power will exceed Integer.MAX_VALUE and the exponent will always be positive. The user may enter a negative base.

There is no starter file for this lab. You must write the entire class. Here is a sample run:
```
Enter the base: 2
Enter the exponent: 4
2 ^ 4 = 16
```
