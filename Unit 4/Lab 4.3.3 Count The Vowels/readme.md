# 4.3.3 CountTheVowels
Write a program that will prompt the user for a word and then print each vowel in the word and the total number of vowels in the word. You may assume that all of the letters will be lower case. Do not count y as a vowel. Here is a sample run:
```
Enter the word: implementation
i e e a i o
Total vowels = 6
```
