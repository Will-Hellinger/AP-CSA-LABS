# 4.2.3 CountDown2
Modify <b>CountDown</b> from lab 4.2.2 so that the user is required to enter a first number that is smaller than the second number. Use a while loop to check for valid input. Once input values are valid, use a for loop to produce the output.

Here is a sample run:
```
First number: 8
Second number: 1
The second number must be larger than the first.
First number: 1
Second number 8
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
