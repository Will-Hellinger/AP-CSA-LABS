# 4.1.2 FromHereToThere
Write a program that allows the user to enter two whole numbers. Print all of the numbers between the first and second number entered by the user. Print each number on a separate line. If the first number is larger than the second number, then the program should not print anything. Do not declare any additional variables other than those shown in the starter file. Here is a sample run:
```
First number? 3
Second number? 8
3
4
5
6
7
8
```
