# 4.1.6 FindMinAndMax
Write a program that allows the user to enter exactly 5 whole numbers that can be positive or negative. The program should then print the largest number that was entered and the smallest number that was entered. (Hint: Use Integer.MIN_VALUE and Integer.MAX_VALUE to initialize the variables that store the minimum and maximum values.) There is no starter file for this lab. You must write the entire class. Here is a sample run:

```
Number: 45
Number: -87
Number: 0
Number: 25
Number: -19
Max value is: 45
Min value is: -87
```
