# Unit 4 - Project - Fibonacci
# <b>Project Description</b>
Name the class for this project <b>Fibonacci</b>.

The Fibonacci sequence is made up of numbers such that each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:

`0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34`

For this project you are to write a program that will allow the user to enter a starting value and an ending value. The starting and ending values will not necessarily be a number in the Fibonacci sequence. The program should then print the Fibonacci numbers that lie between those two numbers if there are any.

For example, if the user enters 4 and 25, the program should print `5 8 13 21`. If there are no values from the Fibonacci sequence between the two input values then the program should print `None found`.

Use single space separation between each printed value.

Here are several sample runs:
```
Enter the starting value: 4
Enter the ending value: 25
5 8 13 21

Enter the starting value: 0
Enter the ending value: 40
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

Enter the starting value: 2
Enter the ending value: 55
2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55

Enter the starting value: 150
Enter the ending value: 200
None found.
```
