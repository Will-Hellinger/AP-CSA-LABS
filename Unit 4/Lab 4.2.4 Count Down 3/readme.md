# 4.2.4 CountDown3
Modify <b>CountDown</b> from 4.2.2 so that it does not matter which number is the largest. The program should always count down from the largest number to the smallest number. Here is a sample run for each situation:

```
First number: 1
Second number: 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
First number: 10
Second number: 1
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
