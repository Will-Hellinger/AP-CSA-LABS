# 6.4.2 Duplicates
Write a method called <b>hasDupes</b> to determine if an array contains any duplicates (same element contained more than once), returning true if so, false if not. There may be more than one way to deal with this algorithm, and if yours differs than another’s, that’s OK, as long as it works!

Expected output:
```
5 23 7 14 39 46 52 65 75 83 76 44 90 6 2 5 
true
```
