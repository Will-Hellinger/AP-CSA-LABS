# 6.3.1 Four Loops
Write a program to instantiate three arrays with at least five elements of your own choosing in each array:

* an integer array
* a String array
* a double array

Do an output traversal of each array twice, once using a <b>traditional loop</b> and then using the <b>enhanced for loop</b> structure.

You must use <b>for loop, while loop</b>, and <b>do while loop</b> at least once each for each first output, and the <b>enhanced for loop</b> three times for the second output of each array.

## <b>It is up to you to choose which traditional loop to use with each array.</b>
- - -

The outputs for each array must match! Include exactly one space between each array element, and start each output sequence on a new line.

For example, if your integer array is:
```
int [] list = {9, 1, 1, 2, 3};
```

â€¦the two outputs for the integer array must be:
```
9 1 1 2 3
9 1 1 2 3
```

The outputs for the String and double arrays might be:
```
one two three four five
one two three four five
1.1 3.4 8.23 9.99 10.03
1.1 3.4 8.23 9.99 10.03
```

Depending on the values chosen for each array, the combined output might be:
```
9 1 1 2 3
9 1 1 2 3
one two three four five
one two three four five
1.1 3.4 8.23 9.99 10.03
1.1 3.4 8.23 9.99 10.03
```
