# Lab 6.1.2 Double Array
Write a program to instantiate an array of doubles called grades to hold nine values.

Output all nine values using a loop.

Write three statements to output the values in the first, middle, and last positions.

Reassign the values in those same positions to grades you have recently earned in this class, and then output the list again.

Create an output statement containing an expression to output the average of only those three grades you just entered using the indexing process.

Required output:
```
1.1 2.2 3.3 4.4 5.5 6.6 7.7 8.8 9.9
