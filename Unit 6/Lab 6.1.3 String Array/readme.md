# Lab 6.1.3 String Array
Write a program to create a String array called friends using an initializer list that contains the first names of five of your classmates. Output each element of the array using the indexing process. Change at least one of the names to another classmate’s first name, and then output all five names again, in the same order as the first output series.

Here is a sample run with five names to begin with, and then one name changed. Use your own classmates’ names with your solution.
