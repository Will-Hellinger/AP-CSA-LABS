# 6.2.1 Week Days
Write a program to instantiate a `String` array called `days` to contain all seven days of the week, in three different languages, English, then Spanish, then any other, such as French, German, Swahili, etc. Output all the array elements in forwards order using a for loop, with a space between each pair of days.

For any language your instructor does not know, be prepared to provide backup documentation justifying your language choice for weekday names.

For example, in English, the output would be:

`Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday`

In Spanish, the output would be:

`domingo lunes martes miercoles jueves viernes sabado`

Include both English and Spanish as your first two examples, and then create a third one of your own choosing.

Sample output:
```
Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
domingo lunes martes miercoles jueves viernes sabado
/* days in a third language */
```
