# 2.9.1 TemperatureDifference
Write a program that will allow the user to enter two temperatures. The program should then print the difference between the temperatures without regard for whether the temperature became warmer or colder. The output should be formatted and labelled just as you see in this sample run:

```
Enter the first number: 50
Enter the second temperature: 75
The temperature changed by 25 degrees.
```
