# Unit 2 - Project - Random Passwords
Often times password protected devices will arrive with a default password installed. One example is a home router for a WIFI network. The consumer is of course supposed to change the factory default password to one of their own choosing.

For this project you are to write a program that will generate random default passwords. Each password must meet the following criteria:

1. Exactly eight (8) random characters or digits.

2. Two characters must be uppercase.

3. Two of the characters must be random digits (0 â€“ 9).

There is no input for this program. The program will simply print out a different random password each time that it is run.

Where your program places the uppercase letters and the digits within the password is up to you. Here are a few examples of random passwords that meet the criteria described above:
