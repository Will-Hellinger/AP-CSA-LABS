# 2.3.1 RectangleFun
Write a program that will allow the user to enter the width, height, and the coordinates for the location of a rectangle. The program should then calculate and print the perimeter of the rectangle. After printing the perimeter, move the rectangle 4 units to the left and 2 units up and print the new location. The prompts and the labels for the output should appear exactly like those shown in the sample run shown below. <i>You are required to use method calls for all calculations and output.</i>

DO NOT use the input variables again to gather data from the user for these required adjustments, rather make the changes in the program using the methods belonging to the object. The signatures for these methods are as follows:
```
public Rectangle(int x,int y,int width,int height)

public double getWidth()

public double getHeight()

public double getX()

public double getY()

public void setLocation(int x,int y)
```

```
Width: 5
Height: 5
X: 3
Y: -5
Perimeter = 14.0
New Location is (-1.0,-3.0)
```
