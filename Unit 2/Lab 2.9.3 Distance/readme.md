# 2.9.3 Distance
Use what you have learned in math class or a textbook or the Internet to find the formula to determine the distance between two points. <i><b>Before you write the program</b></i>, calculate the distance between two different pairs of points of your own choosing. Then write a program that will allow the user to enter the coordinates of two points. The program should then calculate and print the distance between those two points. <i><b>You must use all Math class methods to perform the calculations</b></i>. Test your program using the values you calculated for the points that you chose before you began to code. Format the prompts and the output just as you see in this sample run.

```
Enter the coordinates of the first point (x1,y1): 2 -3
Enter the coordniates of the second point (x2,y2): -4 1
The distance between (2,-3) and (-4,1) is 7.211102550927978
