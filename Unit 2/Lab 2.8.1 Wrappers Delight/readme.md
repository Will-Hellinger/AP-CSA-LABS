# 2.8.1 WrappersDelight
Write a program that will demonstrate using the Integer and Double classes and the concept of <b>autoboxing</b>.

Your program should declare four different variables. Name the variables `num1`, `num2`, `num3` and `num4`.

* In one statement declare num1 as an int and assign the value 14.
* Instantiate `num2` as an `Integer` object using the `Integer` class constructor with 8 as the actual parameter.
* Declare `num3` as `double` and assign 2.5.
* Use <b>autoboxing</b> to declare a `Double` type variable named `num4` and assign to it the sum of `num2` and `num3`.
* Print the value of all four variables as shown below, one on each line.
* Use <b>autoboxing</b> to change the value in `num2` to 5.
* Assign to the variable `num3` the sum of `num1`, `num2` and `num4`.
* Use <b>unboxing</b> and <b>casting</b> to assign to `num1` the sum of `num2` and `num4`.
* Finally, print all four values again as shown in the output below.

Your output should look exactly like the sample output shown below.

Sample output:
```
14
8
2.5
10.5
15
5
29.5
10.5
```
